### **Kenny Light**

Hi, my name is Kenny Light and I currently live in Fort Myers, FL.  I graduated with a degree in Management Information Systems from USF in 2000.  I'm pursuing a masters degree in Software Development.  I'm employed with U.S. Sugar as a Sr. Software Developer, primarely developing with c#, .net, Visual Studio, SQL Server, MVC, WPF, Jquery, Javascript, SSRS, HTML, and CSS.  I'm almost finished with a laboratory information management system (LIMS) application.  This application connects to sugar analysis devices, pulls final analysis, and saves to a database.  I look forward to learning from my peers as well as the teachers/facilitators.

My name is Max Zink. I'm currently living in North Hollywood, CA. I graduated from Pepperdine in 2022 with a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Theatre. I am currently pursuing my masters in software development. Over the years, I've used C, C++, Java, Python, Prolog, R, and more recently, Javascript and SQL. A few projects I've completed include a compiler that translates assembly language into machine language, written in C++, and a Python-based .WAV player. Despite some gaps in my knowledge regarding C# and Javascript, I'm excited to learn from and with my teammates.
